# SQL-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
This project is a Sales Data Analysis using SQL, where I explored a Kaggle dataset containing over 18,000 rows and 9 columns. The dataset includes information such as product names, quantities sold, sales amounts, cities, timestamps, and more.
Key SQL Concepts Applied
